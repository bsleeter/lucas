## Simulate carbon stocks and flows
### *LUCAS* is an open-source [SyncroSim](https://syncrosim.com/) Base Package for simulating carbon dynamics across terrestrial landscapes.


The Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (**LUCAS**) combines a state-and-transition simulation model to predict change in land use/land cover classes, with a stock and flow model to simulate carbon dynamics within a scenario-based framework. The resulting product is a model which tracks changes in land use/land cover, land management, and disturbance, along with the impact of these processes on ecosystem carbon sequestration and carbon flux. By developing **LUCAS** within the [ST-Sim](http://docs.stsim.net/) modeling environment, users are given the flexibility to test a range of future scenarios of land-use and climate change and their impacts on carbon dynamics.

## Requirements

This package requires the [latest SyncroSim release](https://syncrosim.com/download/).
<br>
<br>
## How to Install

Open SyncroSim and select **File -> Packages… -> Install…**, then select the **LUCAS** package and click OK.

Alternatively, download [the latest release from Github](https://github.com/bsleeter/lucas/releases/). Open SyncroSim and navigate to packages, then install from file.
